anlearn - Anomaly learn
=======================
.. image:: img/anomaly-learn-with-text.png

In `Gauss Algorithmic`_, we're working on many anomaly/fraud detection projects using open-source tools. We decided to put our two cents in and  "tidy up" some of our code snippets, add documentation, examples, and release them as an open-source package. So let me introduce **anlearn**. It aims to offer multiple interesting anomaly detection methods in familiar scikit-learn_ API so you could quickly try some anomaly detection experiments yourself.

So far, this package is an alpha state and ready for your experiments.
